# intro

This is a small node.js project to:
- get https://ajv.js.org/ working in a stand-alone project - see `hello.js`
- get a Qunit test of a simple user module working - see `test.html` and `test/user-ensemble-model.js` (`user-ensemble-model.js` is from https://github.com/reichlab/predtimechart/ )
- get experience packaging/bundling a node.js project for use in our two predtimechart applications: https://www.zoltardata.com/ and https://viz.covid19forecasthub.org/
